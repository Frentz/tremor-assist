# Tremor Assist - Adaptive Mouse Movement Assistance

## Mission Statement
To create an intelligent, adaptive mouse movement assistance software that helps individuals with tremors use computers more effectively, particularly for gaming and daily computer use. The software will learn and adapt to each user's unique tremor patterns, providing real-time movement smoothing that adjusts based on various factors such as time of day, stress levels, and physical condition.

## Core Objectives
1. **Personalization**: Create a system that learns and adapts to individual tremor patterns
2. **Real-time Assistance**: Provide immediate, responsive movement smoothing
3. **Contextual Adaptation**: Adjust assistance based on:
   - Time of day
   - User's current activity
   - Stress levels
   - Physical condition
   - Environmental factors

## Target Users
- Primary focus on individuals with various forms of tremors
- Initial testing with family members on both Windows and macOS
- Expandable to broader user base with similar needs

## Technical Vision
- Lightweight, efficient application built with Tauri
- Small, locally-running machine learning model for privacy and performance
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows and macOS)
- User-friendly interface for configuration and monitoring
- Non-intrusive assistance that maintains user control

## Success Criteria
1. Noticeable reduction in mouse movement instability
2. Improved gaming experience for users with tremors
3. Positive user feedback on daily computer usage
4. Successful adaptation to varying tremor intensities
5. Minimal latency impact on mouse movement
6. Easy installation and configuration process
